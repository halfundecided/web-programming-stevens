# Lecture 07: API Development and Intermediate MongoDB

## Intermediate MongoDB

### Advanced Finding
We can find documents many more ways than just matching on multiple fields:
  + Query by subdocuments
  + Query for matches inside an array
  + Query for a field to be one of many values
  + Matching fields that are less than a value
  + Matching fields that are greater than a value
  + Performing a logical query for all matching queries, or any matching queries
  + JavaScript based querying

### Advanced Updatingn
There are many ways we can update documents, rather than just replacing their entire content. 
  + We cann change onnly specific fields 
  + Update subdocuments
  + Increment fields
  + Multiply fields value
  + Remove fields 
  + Update to a minumum value

# CS554 Web Programming2: Lab3

## React Pokedex

For this lab, you will create a very simple Pokedex Single Page Application using React.  
You will be creating a Single Page Application using React that implements the following routes using `creat-react-app` and `react router 4`. You will be using the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html/). You will use the Pokemon, Berries, and Machine listings, as well as the [Resource List](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html/#resource-lists)

## Pages

### `/`

- [ ] The root directory of your application will be a simple page explaining the purpose of your site (to talk about Pokemon, Berries, and Machines). You should also explain what each of these things are, as if this was a little tutorial in Pokemon. Think of this app as your first steps through Palette Town.
- [ ] This page will have a `<Link>` to the Pokemon Listing (`/pokemon/page/0`), The Berry Listing (`/berries/page/0`), and the Machine Listing (`/machines/page/0`)

### `/pokemon/page/:page

This route will render a paginated list of Pokemon. It will use the :page param to determine what page to request from the API. - [ ] If you are on page 0, you will show a button to go to the next page. If you are on page 1+, you will show a next button and a previous button, that will take you to the previous page.

- [ ] **If the Page does not contain any more Pokemon in the list, the SPA will redirect to a 404 page.**

### `/pokemon/:id`

This route will show details about a single Pokemon.

- [ ] If the Pokemon does not exist, the SPA will redirect to a 404 page.

### `/berries/page/:page`

This route will render a paginated list of berries. It will use the :page param to determine what page to request from the API. - [ ] If the Page does not contain any more berries in the list, the SPA will redirect to a 404 page.

### `/berries/:id`

This route will show details about a single berry.

- [ ] If the berry does not exist, the SPA will redirect to a 404 page.

### `/machines/page/:page`

This route will render a paginated list of machines. It will use the :page param to determine what page to request from the API. You will also show some sort of pagination UI (see below).

- [ ] If the Page does not contain any more machines in the list, the SPA will redirect to a 404 page.

### `/machines/:id`

This route will show details about a single machine.

- [ ] If the machine does not exist, the SPA will redirect to a 404 page.
- [ ] Hint: you can use the `ContactContainer` to store a value on the state such as `ShowingDetails`, and in the render method of the `ContactContainer` you can check the state to show if you want to render a `ContactOverview` or a `ContactDetails`.

## Pagination

Pagination can be done using an external library from NPM, such as [react-bootstrap's pagination](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/pagination/) or [react-paginate](https://github.com/AdeleD/react-paginate).  
The minimum you must provide for a pagination UI:

- [ ] If you are on page 0, you will show a button to go to the next page.
- [ ] If you are on page 1+, you will show a next button and a previous button, that will take you to the previous page.

## HTML, Look, and Content

Besides the specified settings, as long as your HTML is valid and your page runs passes a tota11y (Links to an external site.) test, the general look and feel is up to you. If you want to update it, you may; if you do not, that is fine.

I do, however, recommend using React-Bootstrap (Links to an external site.)to make your life easier if you need any UI elements.

## General Requirements

- Remember to submit your package.json file but not your node_modules folder.
- Remember to run HTML Validator and tota11y tests!
- Remember to have fun with the content.
- Remember to practice usage of async / await!
